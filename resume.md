Education
---------

1999-2000
:   **MSc, Real-Time Systems, Computer Engineering**;  University
    of Mälardalen (Västerås)

    *Thesis title: Modular Scheduling in RTLinux*, supervisors:
    Prof. Gerhard Fohler and Mikael Bergqvist, Frontec AB

1995-1999
:   **BSc, Computer Engineering**; University of Mälardalen (Västerås)


Experience
----------

**2005--Present:**

Software Architect, Westermo R&D.  Engineered and designed the WeOS
network operating system.

**2002-2005:**

Consultant, embedded and Linux systems ÅF-System AB, Vasterås

*2004: ABB Force Measurement — Network Security Analysis.*  Security
analysis and firewall recommendations for connecting a time critical
industrial network to an office network with Internet access.  The
Stressometer flatness measuring system is an advanced flatness system for
rolling mills with high demands on network load predictability and quality of
service.

*2002–2005: EssNet AB — Linux USB2 driver development.* Development
of several Linux kernel device drivers for a highly advanced lottery
system.  In particular a Cypress FX2 (USB 2.0) based high–speed scanner
with functions for scanning and calibration, branding of printed receipts,
cashdrawer and dedicated serial port interface. First devleoped for Linux
kernel 2.4 and later ported to Linux 2.6.

Also responsible for continous maintenance of drivers and Linux system
software, at EssNet.

**2000-2002:**

2000–2002 R&D Engineer, RealFast Operating Systems AB, Västerås.

*2002: Mentor Graphics Inc. — Development project in Linux.*  A six month
project for Mentor Graphics to port Linux to the RealFast HW microkernel,
similar to the VxWorks project (below). Testbench (a S/W simulator of
the microkernel), complete system including drivers redesign of the
scheduler etc., all developed using GNU/Linux.

Debugging of the ARM Integrator platform with the Arm AxD debugger using
a MultiICE JTAG probe.

*2001: Mäalardalen University, Västerås.*  Lecturer and examiner for a
course in C programming at the Department of Computer Engineering, IDt.
See the course page for details: http://www.idt.mdh.se/kurser/cd5020/jnnht01/

*2001: Sierra S16.*  Project lead and SW developer for the Sierra real-time
kernel. A minimalistic OS based on the RealFast HW microkernel wrapped with
a SW API to the hardware coupled with an adaptation of NewLib to provide a
limited C library.

Used today in courses given at Mälardalen University.

*2001: Ericsson Radio Systems AB, Nacka Strand.*  Investigation and
demostration of how Linux and RTLinux can replace Enea OSE in Ericsson
switches based on the GPB2, General Purpose Board 2.

*2001: Applied Linux & Embedded Internet Show, Kista.*  Presented, on 5th
April, Linux and other free kernels for embedded and real-time systems. A
rundown of the embedded OS’s eCos and uClinux as well as the real-time OS’s
RTLinux and RTAI. Disscussed how each could be applied to a certain set of
problems and what to whatch out for when choosing a free operating system.

*2000: Ericsson Mobile Data Design AB, Gothenburg.*  A ten month project
with extensive modifications of VxWorks and its microkernel Wind to support
the HW microkernel developed by RealFast. The latter is implemented in
VHDL prototyped on a PMC card with an FPGA.

The goal of the project was to compare the performance of VxWorks with and
without the hardware acceleration. This was done with a simple IP forward-
ing application running in VxWorks on the Ericsson GIC (General Interface
Carrier) board.

The project included debugging of IBM PowerPC 750 using IBM RISCWatch
with a JTAG probe. Including debugging of PCI drivers with SingleStep and
the Vmetro PMC bus analyzer.

Tests and performance measurements made for the evaluation of the project
was, amongst other tools, carried out with an advanced IP packet generator.
The project also included modification and auditing of Ericsson developed
drivers and base platform in VxWorks.

*2000–2002: RealFast (internal work).* Network and systems administration
of Linux, OpenBSD and Solaris machines.

Ported VxWorks to the Real-Time Unit, RTU, a real-time kernel implemented
in VHDL. All kernel primitives in VxWorks was adapted to use the HW micro
kernel.


Technical Experience
--------------------

uftpd
:   Created my own FTP/TFTP server, because all others were
    completely useless.

    * Basic anonymous FTP support
    * TFTP with block-size negotiation
