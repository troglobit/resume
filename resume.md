**2000—2002: RealFast Operating Systems**

R&D Engineer, RealFast Operating Systems AB, Västerås.

2002
:   *Mentor Graphics Inc. — Port Linux to HW microkernel*

    Similar to the VxWork project, but for the Linux kernel using the
    RealFast HW microkernel.  Testbench (SW simulator of microkernel),
    complete system w/ drivers, redesign of the Linux scheduler etc.,
    fully developed in a GNU/Linux environment.
    
    Development was done on the ARM Integrator platform using the Arm
    AxD debugger with a MultiICE JTAG probe.

2001
:   *Mälardalen University, Västerås — Lecturer*

    Lecturer and examiner for a course in C programming at the
    Department of Computer Engineering, IDt.
    <http://www.idt.mdh.se/kurser/cd5020/jnnht01/>

2001
:   *RealFast/Mälardalens Högskola, Västerås — Sierra S16*

    Project lead and developer for the Sierra real-time operating sytem.
    A minimalistic OS based on the RealFast HW microkernel wrapped with
    a small API to the hardware, coupled with GCC and an adaptation of
    NewLib to provide a limited C library.  Used in courses given at
    Mälardalen University, e.g. Sumo robots.

2001
:   *Ericsson Radio Systems AB, Nacka Strand — RTLinux Demo*

    Investigation and demonstration of how Linux, and RTLinux in
	particular, RTLinux can replace Enea OSE in Ericsson telephone
	switches based on the GPB2, General Purpose Board 2.

2001
:   *Applied Linux & Embedded Internet Show, 5th April, Kista — Presenter*

    Presented Linux and other free kernels for embedded and real-time
    systems.  Overview of non-realtime eCos and uClinux, as well as the
    real-time RTLinux and RTAI.  Elaborated on how each could be used,
    strengths and weaknesses, and what to watch out for.

2000
:   *Ericsson Mobile, Gothenburg — Port VxWorks to HW microkernel*

    Extensive modifications of the VxWorks operating system internals,
    the Wind microkernel, to support the HW microkernel developed by
    RealFast, a VHDL kernel core prototyped on a PMC card using an FPGA.
  
    Performance of VxWorks packet forwarding was evaluated with and
	without the hardware acceleration on the Ericsson GIC (General
	Interface Carrier) board using an advanced IP packet generator.
  
    Also, debugging and auditing of Ericsson drivers and base platform
    for the IBM PowerPC 750 using IBM RISCWatch, SingleStep, and Vmetro
    PCI bus analyzer.

2000–2002
:   *RealFast — internal work*

    Network and systems administration of Linux, OpenBSD and Solaris
    machines: maintenance, version control systems, file servers,
    backup, etc.
